The right-hand side is set up like a ratio, but while the numerator is a temperature slope ($dT/dx$), the denominator is a temperature difference.  This actually makes it a little hard to understand what $h$ is:  what does it mean to have $h=1$, or $h=1000$?  It's not clear.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","To more clearly compare the *actual* heat flux with the *potential* heat flux, we need a better sense of how far apart $T_s$ and $T_\\infty$ are.  For instance, look at this simple convective flow:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src = https://github.com/AugustanaPEA/ENGR_321/raw/main/Images/Scaling/length_char.PNG width = 250>\n","</center>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","If $L_c$ is very small, then convection won't matter that much: conduction by itself would produce large fluxes, because the hot surface and cool fluid would already be near to each other.

The denominator (light blue) represents the heat flux we'd have if there were *no* convection, and instead there was a nice linear temperature field from the surface to $L_c$.  In other words, its a ratio that tells us *by what factor convection is increasing the heat transfer*.   And this wondrous factor is called the *Nusselt number*!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","$$Nu = \\frac{hL_c}{k_f} = \\frac{\\color{green}{\\text { Flux with convection }}}{\\color{lightblue}{\\text { Flux if there were no convection}}}$$\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src = https://github.com/AugustanaPEA/ENGR_321/raw/main/Images/Scaling/nusselt.PNG width = 250>\n","</center>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","So the Nusselt number makes more intuitive sense than $h$.  But what *is* $L_c$?  It is called the characteristic length, and it varies by geometry.  The $L_c$ of a pipe flow might be the radius; the $L_c$ of a plate flow might be the length of the plate.  As with the Reynolds number, what matters is that when we compare similar scenarios, we use the same definition of $L_c$."],"metadata":{"id":"GI403dy_NqnO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<br><br><br>\n","\n","---\n","ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·<font size = 5> Active Learning </font> ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·\n","\n","---\n","\n","<br>\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wF9VEwJ-yvK2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from urllib.request import urlretrieve\n","\n","location = 'https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/'\n","folder = 'Support_files/'\n","name = 'Embedded_Qs.ipynb'\n","local, _ = urlretrieve(location + folder + name, name)\n","%run /content/$name\n","\n","#@title ###### Multiple Choice (Choose the correct answer) { run: \"auto\", form-width: \"50%\", display-mode: \"form\" }\n","home = 'https://github.com/AugustanaPEA/ENGR_321/raw/main/Embedded_Qs/'\n","data = display_multC('nusselt',home,0)\n","answer = \"\" # @param [\"\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"]\n","check_multC(data,answer)"],"metadata":{"id":"CiNpX_8fWdHN"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·ğŸ”·\n","\n","---\n","\n","<br><br><br>\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Jl-amJpMDeEy"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"g7KEOvqeNEe8"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}]}
